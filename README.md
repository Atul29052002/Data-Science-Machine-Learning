# 🚀 Path to Data Scientist: The Full Spectrum

This repository, Path to Data Scientist, is my comprehensive learning journal, documenting my end-to-end journey across the modern data landscape. It's a living collection of the notes, practice exercises, and code I create while mastering core skills in:

    📊 Data Analysis: Techniques for data cleaning, visualization, statistical testing, and storytelling.

    🧠 Data Science (ML/DL): Fundamental algorithms, model building, validation, and performance tuning.

    ⚙️ Data Engineering: ETL/ELT pipelines, database design (SQL/NoSQL), cloud data warehousing, and system architecture fundamentals.

    ✨ Generative AI (Gen AI): Exploring LLMs, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and practical applications of generative models.

The goal is to provide a structured, transparent record of my path—from theory to practical application—demonstrating my ability to handle data at every stage.
